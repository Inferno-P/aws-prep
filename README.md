## IAM Summary :closed_lock_with_key:
- Users : Mapped to a physical user. Has a password.
- Groups : Logical entities that contain User. One user can be in more than one group.
- Policies : Set of rules (like a JSON Document) describing the access privileges of a Group/User/Role.
  - A statement in an IAM Policy consists of `Sid, Effect, Principal, Action, Resource, and Condition`. 
  - Version is part of the IAM Policy itself, not the statement. :warning:

- Roles : An _IAM Entity_ that defines a set of permissions for making requests to AWS Services, and will be used by an AWS Service. 
  - Provide access privileges to AWS services to perform actions on behalf of Users.
   
- Security : MFA + Password policy 
- Access Keys : Need these keys to access AWS via CLI or SDK.
  - Access Key is like your username 
  - Secret access key is like your password
- Auditing :
  - IAM Credentials Report (account level info)
  - IAM Access Advisor (user level info)
- __Other Important Stuff :__ :sparkle:
  - _Principle of Least Privileges._

 Sample Codes used :
 ```
#!/bin/bash
# Use this script for user data
# install httpd 
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1> Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

```

## Amazon EC2 Summary ðŸ’»
- Solving the 'compute' problem.
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- Not just 1 service, it's a collection of services :
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data ono virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services (ASG)
- EC2 Sizing and Config Options 
  - OS - Linux, Windows, Mac OS
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - Storage Space:
    - Network Attached (EBS and EFS)
    - Hardware (EC2 instance store)
  - Network : Speed, Public IP Address
  - Firewall Rules : ```Security Groups```
  - Bootstrap Script (configure at first launch) : ``EC2 User data``
    - Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
    - The boostrap script is only run once at the instance first start. 
    - Commands like : *Installing Updates, Softwares, Downloading files from internet, etc.*
    - ``root user`` used too execute bootstraping script.
  
### EC2 Pricing :receipt:
1. On-Demand Instance (OD)
	-	__Pay for what you use.__ _Linux/Windows - pay per second, after 1st min. Other OSs - billing per hour._
	-	Highest Cost, but no upfront payment.
	-	`Short-term, irregular and un-interrupted workloads`
	-	No long term commitment.

2. Reserved Instance (RI)
	- 72% cheaper vs On-Demand. Reserve specific instance attributes __(Instance Types, Region, Tenancy, OS)__
	- __Reservation Features__:
		- Period - 1 year or 3 years ('Standard' Reserved)
		- Payment Options - No Upfront(+), Partial Upfront(++), All Upfront(+++)
		- Scope - Regional or Zonal (reserved capacity in an AZ)
	- `Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)`
	- Can buy and sell in the reserved instance market place when not in use anymore.
	- Post the Reserved instance usage, pricing returns to On-Demand rates.
	- 'Convertible' Reserved : Flexible on EC2 instance type, family OS, scope and tenancy. Less Discount - 66%.
	
3. Saving Plan Instance (SP)
	- Discount on Long-term usage. (upto 72% - same as RIs) 
	- Commitment required : Consistent usage $10/Hr for 1 or 3 years
	- Usage beyond commitment is priced @ On-Demand Rates.
	- Locked to instance family & AWS Region. (Eg. M5 in us-east-1). Flexible on Instance Size, OS and Tenancy (Hst Dedicated, Default)

4. Spot Instance 
	- Discount upto 90% vs On-Demand
	- Most cost efficient.
	- `Workloads with flexible start and end times that can withstand interruptions.`
	- Eg : Batch Jobs, Img Processing. Not recommended for Databases.

5. Dedicated Host and Instance (DH)
	- HOST
		- A physical servers with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
		- Useful to address __compliance requirements__ and use your existing server-bound software licences (per-socket, per-core, per VM S/W Licenses) 
		- Purchasing Options : __On-Demand__ pay per second for active dedicated host. __Reserved__ 1 or 3 years (All upfront only)
		- Most Expensive.
		- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model. (BYOL - Bring Your Own License).  _Eg: Oracle Netsuite, Adobe Photoshop, etc.
	- INSTANCE
		- Instances run on h/w that's dedicated to you.
		- May share h/w with other instances in same account.
		- No control over instance placement. 
6.  Capacity Reservation Instances
	- Reserved On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration.
	- No time commitment. No billing discounts.
	- Combine w/ Regional Reserved 
	 - Charged @ On-Demand rates whether use or not.

# Security Groups ðŸ‘®
- Kinda like 'Firewalls' on EC@ instances.
- Important for network security in AWS
- Security groups only contain __ALLOW__ rules.
- __Rules__ : Control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances.
  - Access to ports.
  - Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
  - Control of inbound network (outside to instance).
  - Control of outbound network (instance to outside).
  - Default Rules : All inboound traffic is blocked. All outbound traffic is allowed.
- __Important Points__
  - Can be attached to multiple instance. An instance can have multiple security groups attached.
  - Locked to a region/VPC comobination. If we change regions, we will have to create different SG.
  - SGs do not run on EC2. They lie outside and if they block some data, then the underlying EC2 won't see it.
- __Example :__
 There is a EC2 machine called `X1` with 2 security groups attached to it called `SG1` and `SG2`. 
 Denoted by `X1[SG1, SG2]`.
 There are other EC2 machines called `X2` and `X3` with security groups SG1 and SG2 attached, respectively.
 Denoted by `X2[SG1]`, `X3[SG2]`.
 
 The EC2 machines with same SG can intereact with each other. i.e. `X2` and `X3` can signal `X1` since they have same SGs.
 
`X2[SG1] -> X1[SG1, SG2]` and `X3[SG2] -> X1[SG1, SG2]`

- Ports :
   - 22 = SSH into Linux
   - 21 = FTP
   - 22 = SFTP 
   - 80 = HTTP
   - 443 = HTTPS
   - 3389 = RDP into Windows instance
