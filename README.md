## IAM Summary 
- Users : Mapped to a physical user. Has a password.
- Groups : Logical entities that contain User. One user can be in more than one group.
- Policies : Set of rules (like a JSON Document) describing the access privileges of a Group/User/Role.
  - A statement in an IAM Policy consists of `Sid, Effect, Principal, Action, Resource, and Condition`. 
  - Version is part of the IAM Policy itself, not the statement. :warning:
